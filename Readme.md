# CI/CD Pipeline

This repository serves as a production-ready reference for CI/CD workflows built and maintained by me.

It showcases how I design and automate delivery pipelines to reliably build, test, and deploy applications across cloud environments.

The project demonstrates multiple real-world CI/CD approaches:

- AWS CI/CD using CodePipeline and CodeBuild to automate builds and deployments on AWS

- GitHub Actions for continuous integration, testing, and container image builds

- GitLab CI for pipeline orchestration and environment-based deployment workflows

- GitOps principles, where Git acts as the single source of truth and changes to the main branch drive automated deployments

This setup reflects how modern cloud engineering teams ship software: automation first, minimal manual intervention, and consistent deployments across environments.
